# Getting started with Neon and Dart

## Clone the repository

```bash
npx degit neondatabase/examples/with-dart ./with-dart
```

## Store your Neon credentials

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://neondb_owner:...@ep-...us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require"
```

- `user` is the database user.
- `password` is the database user’s password.
- `endpoint_hostname` is the host with neon.tech as the [TLD](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/dns/top-level-domain/).
- `dbname` is the name of the database. “neondb” is the default database created with each Neon project.
- `?sslmode=require` an optional query parameter that enforces the [SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/what-is-ssl/) mode while connecting to the Postgres instance for better security.

**Important**: To ensure the security of your data, never expose your Neon credentials to the browser.

Use the `endpoint_hostname` as `host`, `dbname` as `database`, `user` as `username`, and `password` as is in the `index.dart` file.

Run the command below to install project dependencies:

```
dart pub get
```

Run the Dart application using the following command:

```
dart run index.dart
```
